# Hubbub

Stress test demo for sending a huge volume of messages (between packages/modules -- does it make a difference?)

Click on the (-/+) buttons in the UI to change the base/exponent of the number of messages being sent.

Use left/right arrow keys and spacebar to move the platformer character around in order to feel the effect of message lag.
